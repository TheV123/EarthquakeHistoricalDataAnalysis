# Introduction

We are interested in furthering the development models which can accurately predict earthquakes. Our goal is to perform an in-depth analysis on an existing model to see how it aligns with observed United States Geological Survey (USGS) records on earthquakes. We aim to do this using a combination of advanced data analysis techniques. Our assessment will help conclude whether this model can provide predictuve insights about seismic activity, or if a new direction is required to advance this research.
