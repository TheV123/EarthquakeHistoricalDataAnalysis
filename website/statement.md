## Introduction
ETAS is a machine learning model that simulates earthquakes. It relies on commonly-used formulas to simulate the time, location, and magnitude of earthquakes.

## Objectives
This research aims to understand whether ETAS can accurately simulate the magnitudes and locations of earthquakes. By using data analysis to compare ETAS data with USGS records, we are able to determine the accuracy of this model and discover potential limitations. This understanding can be used to fine-tune future machine learning models, improving on areas where ETAS was successful and changing aspects where it failed. Specific areas of interest are:
    1. Does ETAS data generally align with USGS records?
    2. Does ETAS generate more or less high-magnitude earthquakes?
    3. What are the energies generated by ETAS data, and is this consistent with USGS records?
        - Can ETAS replicate high-energy events (days with multiple earthquakes)?
    4. Does ETAS accurately predict aftershocks for high-magnitude earthquakes?
    5. How frequently do high-magnitude earthquakes appear in ETAS simulations?

### Data Collection:
We use the following earthquake-related data to compare ETAS and USGS data:
    - Coordinates
    - Magnitude 
    - Date & Time
