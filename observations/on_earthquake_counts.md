Several questions came to my mind on why some months have an unusally high number of earthquakes. Is this an issue with data reporting, or just that there is a very high number of earthquakes those months? 

Breaking up the data into day by day we see some days with HUNDREDS of earthquakes
How is that possible? What are the locations of these earthquakes? Based on our previous insights we found that days with a large number of earthquakes often are close to days where a large earthquake has happened.

But other sources (involved with USGS) have also shown this - (page 17)

When looking at time periods of 1 week before and after a day of high earthquake count I noticed some trends in the shape of the plots, which seem to resemble a upside down V. However, I noticed some descrepencies in the USGS data grouped by day was that sometimes there are no earthquakes before large counts, especially earlier in the data

Plotting the graphs on top of each other shows the trend more clearly

When looking at the location of earthquakes on the days of high earthquake counts we can see that these earthquakes are generally clustered in the same area - i will have to make improvements to the graph to see if they are in a similar date but currently I just added a hover feature
