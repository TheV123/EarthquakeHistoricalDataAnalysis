## Introduction
- introduce ETAS
- something about comparing etas to usgs data

## Problem Statement
The research addresses whether ETAS data can accurately model and predict the amount of earthquakes and the location at which they occur (within California). Further comparisons are made to check if energy generated by ETAS models and USGS records align. This study aims to advance research in earthquake forecasting, specifically in risk assessment and location prediction, by answering the following question: Can a model accurately predict the locations, magnitudes, and energies of earthquakes? 

## Objectives

### Development
write about ETAS here?

**Expected Benefits/Impact:**
- Increased speed in computations required for earthquake prediction. 
- Enhanced understanding of earthquake patterns and relationships.
- Reliable predictions for real-world applications.

What is the purpose of our research?
How will our findings on data comparisons help future models on earthquakes?
Can we show links between magnitude and multiplicity? 
Can we show trends in the time before and after large events?

## Methodology
### Data Collection:
- Gather relevant earthquake-related data:
    - Coordinates
    - Magnitude 
    - Date & Time
