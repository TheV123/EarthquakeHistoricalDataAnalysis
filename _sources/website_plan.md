Here is the plan for the website:
The goal of the website is going to be to show a cohesion between our code. We are going to have to restructure the code to be more cohesive and delete parts that dont fit.
Here is the layout
1. intro
2. statement
3. data comparisons
   * usgs vs etas historical analysis
   * grouped by month and day
4. relationship between magnitude and multiplicity
   *  energy comparisons
   *  explain about memo to prof rundle
5. large event analysis
   * time before/after large events
   * overlay with fault map
6. time until large earthquake
   * analyzing how energy changes between large earthquakes
   * analyzing how energy changes by grid between large earthquakes
     * maybe an animated plot of energy on each grid until the next large earthquake (maybe later)
7. location/energy analysis
   * energy analysis on grids comparing usgs vs etas
