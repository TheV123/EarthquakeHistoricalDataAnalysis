# Introduction

We are interested in furthering the development models which can accurately predict earthquakes. Our goal is to perform an in-depth analysis on the Epidemic Type Aftershock
Sequence (ETAS) to see how it aligns with observed United States Geological Survey (USGS) records on earthquakes. We aim to do this using a combination of many advanced data analysis techniques and will provide helpful charts and graphs showing this comparison. We also hope to find trends and statistics within recorded earthquake data in USGS to help future model authors to better predict earthquakes
