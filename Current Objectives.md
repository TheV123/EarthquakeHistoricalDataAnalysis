# Current Objectives

##  Historical Analysis
* Find trends that we can use
  *  Magnitude, multiplicity, energy
  *  Location based trends - 11km by 11km or 1/10th of a degree

Questions
* Is it possible to expand the time intervals of ETAS?
  * No??

##  Comparing ETAS to Real data
* Is ETAS showing similar data?
  * Compare # of earthquakes, magnitude, energy
  * Validating ETAS data with real world data

## Time between large Earthquakes
* Time series - trends with the number of eathquakes
* Looking at how long earthquake multiplicity decreases until a spike happens
  * Compare USGS and ETAS Data
  * Can we look at the time between large earthquakes for different regions?
  * Can we give an estimate to the time until the next large earthquake?


## Fixing issue of Aftershock
* Earthquake aftershock is counted multiple times in USGS dataset (and ETAS)
  * How will be able to accurately account for that?
