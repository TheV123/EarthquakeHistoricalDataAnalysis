## Introduction
- introduce ETAS
- something about comparing etas to usgs data

## Problem Statement
The research addresses whether ETAS data can accurately model and predict the amount of earthquakes and the location at which they occur (within California). Further comparisons are made to check if energy generated by ETAS models and USGS records align. This study aims to advance research in earthquake forecasting, specifically in risk assessment and location prediction, by answering the following question: Can a model accurately predict the locations, magnitudes, and energies of earthquakes? 

## Objectives

### Development
write about ETAS here?

**Expected Benefits/Impact:**
- Increased speed in computations required for earthquake prediction. 
- Enhanced understanding of earthquake patterns and relationships.
- Reliable predictions for real-world applications.

### Validity
 Validate the model by comparing its predictions with USGS records.  

**Expected Benefits/Impact:**
- Quantitative assessment of the surrogate model's accuracy.
- Confidence in its reliability for earthquake prediction.
- Identification of potential improvements.

## Methodology
### Data Collection:
- Gather relevant earthquake-related data:
    - Coordinates
    - Magnitude 
    - Date & Time 

### Model Training and Testing:
don't think we did this?
- Identify suitable datasets and use them to train the model.
- Validate the model's performance by comparing its generated data to USGS records.
